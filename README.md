# MEXC_API

I used the MECX exchange API (https://github.com/mexcdevelop/mexc-api-sdk) and wrote this api.py script. With this scriot I will have access to my spot account on MEXC exchnage and generat two figures that show my current portfolio for Spot holdings.
You should run the api.py script in this directory: mexc-api-sdk/dist/python/mexc-sdk-1.0.0/src
